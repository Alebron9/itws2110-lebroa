# Lab 8 - SQL & PHP

## Challenges
The main challenge was representing the phpMyAdmin query results in text format. For the last 4 SQL queries (alphabetical order, grades > 90, average grades, and student counts), I created custom formatted text tables since the phpMyAdmin output couldn't be easily copied and pasted while maintaining readability.

## Summary
This lab provided practical experience with creating relational databases, using foreign keys, and writing SQL queries in phpMyAdmin. The database was successfully created with all required tables and data.
