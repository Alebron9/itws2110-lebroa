# Lab 1 Writeup

The idea to use iframes to have a consistent sidebar when browsing our individual pages was inspired by Malik's personal website; I discovered however that his HTML was written long enough ago to have a number of deprecated tags for which support was being phased out. The implementation turned out very well, tying all of our individual pages together cleanly.

We ran into issues in getting everybody to update their branches before adding their individual work, and so on occasion had to make manual changes in main. Deciding on the creative direction of our group page was a challenge, due to being undecided on what finance project we would pursue. We decided on separate CSS for our individual portfolios until we got a better idea of what we were looking for.

In returning to writing HTML and CSS after a year since Intro, I found that visualizing the placement of elements was still somewhat of a challenge. In my personal portfolio, I had to use a flexbox to position my personal photo horizontally alongside my hCard. As I continue with the rest of the labs, I want to expand my knowledge of CSS and its variety of properties, along with continuing to refresh my memory from our prior web development class.

Aligning the education, work experience and skills sections proved troublesome at first, as the sections would not align side-by-side as desired. In the end, I moved the sections into a few new divs and combined parts of the css while adding new css to make it work. W3Schools was used during this process.
