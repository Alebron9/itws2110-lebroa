3.1:
When designing this project manager application quiz, I made several key decisions that really shaped how the application works. First, I chose to use a simple gradient purple theme with clear navigation because I wanted users to feel comfortable and not overwhelmed when logging in for the first time. I also decided to separate the project creation page from the dashboard, which allowed users to have a dedicated space just for managing projects without cluttering the main dashboard. Another important decision was making nicknames the primary login identifier instead of email addresses, which made the login process simpler and more memorable for users. I was surprised by how much these small design choices impact the overall user experience and how important it is to think about usability from the start.

3.2:
If a user came to the site for the very first time and no database existed, I would implement an installation script that automatically creates all necessary tables and sets up the application. The installer would first check if the database connection fails, and if it does, it would redirect the user to an installation page that allows them to run the setup SQL queries. I would provide a simple button that users could click to execute the setupDB.txt file, which would create the database, all three tables, and insert initial sample data automatically. After the installation completes successfully, the application would then redirect the user to the login page so they could start using the application immediately. This approach would make the setup process seamless and prevent users from seeing confusing database error messages on their first visit.

3.3:
To prevent duplicate entries for the same project, I already implemented a UNIQUE constraint on the project name column in the database, which prevents two projects from having identical names. However, I could add additional functionality on the application level by implementing a real-time check that alerts users as they type the project name to see if it already exists. I would use an AJAX request that queries the database every time the user finishes typing in the project name field, displaying a warning message if that project name is already taken. I could also add a dropdown suggestion feature that shows existing project names similar to what the user is typing, helping them avoid accidentally creating duplicates. What surprised me was how much better the user experience becomes when you prevent errors before they happen rather than just showing an error message after submission.

3.4:
3.4.1: To support a voting system, I would create two new tables: a presentations table that stores information about each project presentation being voted on, and a votes table that records each individual vote cast by a user. The presentations table would contain presentationId, projectId, and other relevant presentation details, while the votes table would store voterId, presentationId, and a timestamp of when the vote was cast.

3.4.2: The presentations table would have a foreign key linking back to the projects table, and the votes table would have foreign keys linking to both the users table (for the voter) and the presentations table (for what they're voting on). I would add a UNIQUE constraint on the combination of voterId and presentationId to ensure each user can only vote once per presentation, similar to how I prevented duplicate project memberships.

3.4.3: To prevent users from voting on their own project, I would check if the user is a member of the project being voted on by querying the projectMembership table before allowing them to submit a vote. If the user is found in the projectMembership table for that project's presentationId, I would display a message saying they cannot vote on their own project and disable the voting button. This check would happen both on the server-side for security and on the client-side for immediate user feedback, ensuring users cannot vote for themselves even if they try to manipulate the request.
